# Basal Ganglia Transcriptomics Analysis for Parkinson’s Disease

# Overview

This repository presents an analysis of basal ganglia transcriptomics data obtained from the Allen Institute. The primary goal of this study is to identify and characterise cell-type clusters that may be relevant to Parkinson’s disease.
Single-cell gene expression profiles are analysed to uncover distinct cellular populations and their transcriptional signatures within the basal ganglia.
Dataset
The dataset used in this study originates from the Allen Institute for Brain Science and contains transcriptomic measurements from basal ganglia cell populations.

# Methods

The analysis pipeline follows standard single-cell RNA-seq workflows and includes:
    1. Data loading and preprocessing
    2. Quality control and filtering
    3. Normalisation and scaling
    4. Dimensionality reduction using PCA
    5. Non-linear embedding with UMAP
    6. Cell-type clustering
    7. Visualisation and interpretation of clusters
